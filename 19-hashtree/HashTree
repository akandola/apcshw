Difference between:
	1) HashMap and HashSet:
A hashmap is assigning a value to a key and putting it into a list. You can repeat values, and it can be unsynchronized. It allows null for both key and value. 
A hashset doesn't allow duplicate values, and provides an add method, and a contain method to see if the value is already in the hashset. It maintains a unique list. The hashmap as keyed access to each value, whereas the set is an unordered collection.


	2) TreeMap and TreeSet
They are both sorted collections, but htey implement different interfaces (Map vs. Set, respectively). TreeSet only stores obe object but TreeMap, similar to HashMap, stores 2 objects (a key and value, where the key accesses the value). TreeSet doens't allow duplicate objects but you can have duplicate values in TreeMap (probably because keys can differentiate).
